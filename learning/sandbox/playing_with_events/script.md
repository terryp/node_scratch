# Emitting Events

## Introduction

Yep, here's another talk on Node.js! Why, I have no idea. But I've been doing more programming in my spare time and I showed Manderson some of my code and he graciously cleaned it up and included a little tidbit that inspired this talk. 

## Flow Control

I'm still struggling with the primary notion of flow control in Node.js. I attribute this to two things: 1) I'm not a very good programmer and 2) I don't naturally think asynchronously. Thinking serially or procedurely means decidedly less planning - it's easier and it's performant, until it isn't. 

What I've learned is that there are two pretty good strategies for dealing with control flow (1) Callbacks and (2) Events.
