- 01_playing_with_functions.js / Declaration and invocation.

- 02_playing_with_functions.js / Function arguments/parameters.

- 03_playing_with_functions.js / Three ways of writing functions in JavaScript.

- 04_playing_with_functions.js / This is about callbacks, right?

- 05_playing_with_functions.js / Functions are first class citizens.

- 06_playing_with_functions.js / Callbacks as a path to asynchronous
programming
