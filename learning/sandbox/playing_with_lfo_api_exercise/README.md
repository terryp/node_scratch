## Overview

This is a horrible experiment that I'm inflicting on myself. Basically, I'm trying to do an exercise that we hand out to potential candidates. I actually had to do this a long time ago when I, myself, became an SE. It was so long ago that the code was PHP and the tough questions were SQL. 

I digress.
