# Function Parameters

- Functions in JavaScript are unique in that they allow any number of params to be passed regardless of the number of parameters declared in the function definition. 

# Default Function Parameters

- Defaults will only trigger if (1) No argument is placed or (2) the value of the argument placed is undefined. 

- If you pass a `null` value ... it won't trigger a default since `null` is valid.

# Explain/Explore for Yourself

- The merits of the ternary operator ... good, bar or indifferent ....
- The `===` operator ... is about strict equality for `type` and `value`.
