# JavaScript Closures

- I'm going to talk about closures today, since I've been using the term for a very long time - and I still use it - but I have really no concept of what the hell a closure is or what it's good for. 

## What Is a Closure, Part 1

- From the incredible tome, "JavaScript for Dummies" Morris John's gives two very succint definitions:

1. A closure is the local variables for a function - kept alive *after* the function has returned. 

2. A closure is a stack-frame which is not deallocated when the function returns. 

- Yeah, I don't get that either. 

## What Is a Closure, Part 2

- Anytime you use a 'function' within a 'function' - you're creating a closure.

- Or better, an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) functions variables and scope chain.
