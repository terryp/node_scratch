# TMTOWTDI Iteration

## Context

When I was learning Perl, a very long time ago, I remember being introduced to the concept of Tim Toady. Tim Toady isn't an actual person; it's the phoenetic pronunciation of the acronym TMTOWTDI. TMTOWTDI stands for `There's More Than One Way to Do It`.

For a long period of time, I simply accepted this as `the way it is`. I didn't really think to challenge that idea. In fact, I think around the same time I was reading an Emerson quote on Slashdot that kind of supported it. `A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines`.

In some kind of oddball way, I was becoming this incredibly proto Libertarian programmer that appreciated the artistic freedom to do whatever you wanted. As a kid that went to Catholic school, I feel like this was my chance to professional explore the ideas of Montessori school.

A long time elapsed, and I continued to believe that TMTOWTDI was the best way. I brought this with me into my experiences with Ruby. I felt like this was the way.

But then, a good friend of mine introduced me to Python. Tim Peter's a Python core committer started writing this ethos called `The Zen of Python`. Part of the `Zen of Python` is the following maxim: `There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it`.

    - sequential for    /
    - for ... in        / Used for Enumeration; no guarantee about order?
    - for ... of        /
    - forEach           /
